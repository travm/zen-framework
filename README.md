# Zen Framework

An opinionated web framework designed to create a consistent structure with a flexible and efficient styling strategy. Greatly inspired by the CSS Zen Garden.

# Getting Started

If you would like to create a design for the Zen Framework, you can do so by targetting each element manually or you could download our starter CSS, Essence, which is pre-built with all of the elements that you will need to target.
